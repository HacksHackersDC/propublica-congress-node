[API Docs](http://developer.nytimes.com/docs/read/congress_api)

Plan to add methods for all endpoints; currently only supports endpoints listed under Bills.

## TODO

### Endpoints
- [ ] Add Members endpoints
- [ ] Add Votes endpoints
- [ ] Add Nominees endpoints
- [ ] Add Other endpoints

### Misc
- [ ] validate params against params.js
- [ ] Default to current congress if none specified
